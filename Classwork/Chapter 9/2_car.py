# SUMMARY:
# This program defines a Car class that stores basic information about a car,
# including make, model, year, and mileage (odometer_reading).
# It includes methods to:
#  - return a formatted name for the car,
#  - display the carâ€™s current mileage,
#  - update the odometer safely (preventing rollback),
#  - and increment the mileage by a given amount.
# At the bottom, two Car objects are created (a new Audi and a used Subaru),
# their odometers are updated/incremented,
# and their details and mileage are printed.
